### Everything in JavaScipt happens inside an Execution Context

- Variable Enviornment (Memory component where everything like variables and functions are stored as key value pair)
- Thread of Execution (Code component where code is executed one line at a time)

### JavaScript is a 'Synchronous' 'Single-threaded' language

### Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution context

### JS

- JS is a single-threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language
- JS has a call stack, an event loop, a callback queue, some other apis
- V8 has stack and heap
- the call stack => one thread == one call stack == one thing at a time
